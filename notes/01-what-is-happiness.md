What is Happiness?
==================

Historical perspectives
-----------------------

### Confucius

~500 BC

Jen (or Ren). Dignity, reverence and humanity towards others. Bring the good in
others to completion, and don't bring the bad in them to completion.

### Buddhism

~500 BC

If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. And if you want to be
happy, practice compassion.
-- Dalai Lama

Pathway to Nirvana starts from recognizing (1) that there is a lot of suffering,
(2) that we suffer because of illusions, because we desire things that don't
make us happy, because we're ignorant. => We find happiness when we detach from
earthly things.

Practices like equanimity, kind speech, karuna (compassion).

### Taoism

~500 BC

Lao Tzu (Tao Te Ching): Happiness is often paradoxical, experienced through the
heart rather than the mind.

When man is born he is tender and weak; at death he is stiff and hard. All
things, the grass as well as the trees, are tender and subtle while alive; when
dead, they are withered and dried.
-- Lao Tzu

=> Weakness and tenderness are the pathway to life.

### Greek philosophy

~500 BC

Aristotle: Summing up one's virtuous acts at the end of one's life. Principle of
moderation: "Everybody can become angry; that's easy. But to be angry at the
right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right
purpose and the right way, that's not within everybody's power and that's not
easy."

### Hedonism

Coming from Europe, France in particular. Happiness is found in pleasure and
sensations, and in the absence of pain.

Epicurean philosophy.

### Utilitarianism

Enlightenment: Utilitarianism. John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, ...: Happiness
is found in your actions that bring about the greatest happiness for the
greatest number of people.

### Many others

Christian traditions, Yoga, ...

In the west, happiness is a lot about achievement, self-gratification, etc. In
the east it's more about relationships, community, family and duty.


Defining and measuring happiness
--------------------------------

Positive Psychology: Marty Seligman, Chris Peterson, ...

Interestingly, 50 years ago there were many studies of anger, fear, anxiety,
divorces, diseases... but very few studies on gratitude, compassion, happy
couples, robust physical health.

Kahnemann: four areas of happiness.

- Well-being: My life is going well.
- Traits: I'm optimistic, I tend to be content, ...
- Emotions: I feel good, reverence, gratitude.
- Sensation: The sun feels really good on my skin right now.

Studies:

- Observational, sampling: How do you feel right now?
- Cross-sectional, correlational: Do more grateful people feel more happy?
- Longitudinal: Study people's lives over time.
- Experiments: Compare effects of specific emotions.

Measurement: How do you measure happiness?

- What seems to work best is a self-reporting approach (Ed Diener, UIUC, and his
  happiness scales).

  - Satisfaction with life scale
  - Scale of positive and negative experiences

  Many studies show correlations of this with life expectancy, creativity, ...

- Experience sampling approach: Matt Killingsworth

  Ping people on their smartphone and ask what they are doing/feeling right now.

- Behavioral indicators

  Do people smile? Videotype them and find out how often they do it.

  Dopamine network, Vagus nerve, ...
